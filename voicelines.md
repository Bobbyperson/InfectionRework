# Voicelines
Probably like 2-5 variations per line depending on how common they are.
So far this is a rough draft of what the faction leader will say, it'll be refined more when the lore is finalized.

## Survivor dialogue

#### SURVIVOR_ROUND_START
Get in. Get the data. Get to the dropship.

#### SURVIVOR_ROUND_START_SIMULATION
Just a simulation this time pilots. Stick together and survive.

#### SURVIVOR_FIRST_INFECTED
Heads up pilots, infected signatures are being detected in the mission area.

#### SURVIVOR_CHOSEN_AS_INFECTED
Pilot! I'm starting to lose your signal, what's going on?

#### SURVIVOR_HALF_ALIVE
We're getting torn up out there! I've activated some old terminals, see if they do anything useful.

#### SURVIVOR_LAST_ALIVE
You're the last one! We're dropping you one of our last titans, just survive for a little bit longer!

#### SURVIVOR_VICTORY
We did it! I can't believe we did it! We're one step closer to solving this mess.

#### SURVIVOR_VICTORY_LAST_ALIVE
I got what I need pilot. I can't risk extracting you, I'm sorry, you're left for dead.

## Infected dialogue
When it comes to the infected dialogue, I'm not sure exactly how this'll pan out, maybe the faction leader will be something like Halo Infinite? We'll have to see what makes the most sense after the lore is finalized.

#### INFECTED_FIRST_INFECTED
You are mine now. Infect all who oppose me.

#### INFECTED_HALF_ALIVE
